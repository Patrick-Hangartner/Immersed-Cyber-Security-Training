Immersive Cyber Security Training is a platform designed to engage all ages while providing educators and administrators robust controls to tailor training content for any user.

My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of a phinishing email and welcome email. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

● Created a robust and scalable email service leveraging the powerful features of SendGrid and the C# programming language in the .NET framework, enabling seamless communication with clients and reducing operational overhead through efficient code reuse.

● Designed and implemented a simulated phishing email, leveraging C# programming language to create a realistic and challenging exercise for cybersecurity trainees.

● Developed HTML email templates using C#, providing an efficient and scalable solution for creating visually appealing and engaging email campaigns. 

● Created custom models, domains, and interface services using C# and the .NET Core framework to design API endpoints, enabling efficient and secure communication between different software components.

● Utilized GitHub as a source control system to ensure code quality, continuity, and consistency among team members during pull requests, fostering collaboration and effective project management. 

● Leveraged Postman for efficient API testing and iteration by creating HTTP requests, streamlining the development process and ensuring that API endpoints were reliable and consistent. 

● Implemented Agile methodology, effectively communicating goals and blockers during daily standups, and reviewing code functionality during code reviews, enabling efficient project management and successful team collaboration.
